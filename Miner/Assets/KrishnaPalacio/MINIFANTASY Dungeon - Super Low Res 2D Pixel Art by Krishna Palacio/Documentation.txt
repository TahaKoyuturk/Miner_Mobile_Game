Rule Tile
	The Demo - Tileset scene makes use of a Rule Tile to create the walls.
	In order to show the scene properly and make use of the Rule Tile, you will need to have downloaded and imported the 2D Tilemap Extras package.
	If you are using a Unity Version 2020 or older, you will need to enable preview packages in "Package Manager > Advanced Project Settings > Enable Preview Packages."
	If you are using a Unity Version 2021 or newer, the package should appear in the Unity Registry as a standard package.

	When using the Wall Rule Tile, the wall will appear red when the wall is considered incomplete.
	You may change these settings by opening the Rule Tile object in "Tile Palettes > Rule Tiles > Wall."

Random Brush
	In order to place tiles randomly we recommend using the random brushes included in the 2D Tilemap Extras package.
	For Unity versions 2021 and above: Link here https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@2.0/manual/index.html
	For Unity versions 2020 and below: Link here https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@1.6/manual/index.html

Sorting Layer Setup
	All objects are on the default layer. The objects are grouped as follows:
	-10	Ground
	-9	Ground Decoration, Holes	
	-8	Ground Shadow			Defined as: shadows that rest on the ground.
	-7	Walls
	-6	Walls Decoration
	-5	Walls Shadow			Defined as: shadows that rest on walls.
	-4	
	-3		
	-2	
	-1	
	0	Characters, Props, Prop Shadows
	1	Above (DoorwayTop)

Placing Objects in the Scene
	We recommend one of these two options for maintaining crisp pixels while moving objects around the scene:
		1. Grid Snapping
			Set Size = 0.125 (1 pixel)
			You can change this setting in "Edit > Grid and Snap Settings > World Grid > Size."
		2. Grid and Snap Increment Snap
			Set Move = 0.125 (1 pixel) or 0.0625 (1/2 pixel)
			You can change this setting in "Edit > Grid and Snap Settings > Increment Snap > Move."
			Then hold ctrl while moving objects to increment their position based on the move setting.
